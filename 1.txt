1. some tools to use
	package management
		Linux or BSD come with it, yum or apt-get
		Mac OS X, MacPorts and Homebrew (Homebrew is simpler)
		Windows, Chocolatey or Cygwin in tandem with the apt-cyg package manager (similar to Debian’s apt-get package manager)
			Chocolatey
				a command line application installer for Windows based on a developer-centric package manager called NuGet
				adds, updates, and uninstalls programs in the background requiring very little user interaction

			Cygwin
				a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.
				a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.
				so with Cygwin, the apt-cyg package manager can be used
			Win 10 also ships with the PackageManagement tool
	version control
		git
	package manager for Python
		Pip (Pip Install Python)
		
2. Chocolatey
	choco install [program name]		install
	choco search [keyword]			search for program name

				</packages>
	choco update [program name]		update
